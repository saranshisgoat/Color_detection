Color Detection README
This README provides an overview of a Python application that detects colors in an image and displays the name of the detected color along with its RGB values. This application uses OpenCV (cv2) and pandas libraries to achieve this functionality.

Application Overview
The Color Detection is a Python script that allows you to:

Load an image (pic1.jpg by default).
Click on a specific area of the image to detect the dominant color at that location.
Display the name of the detected color and its corresponding RGB values.
Display the color name and RGB values in a rectangle on the image.
Prerequisites
Before running the Color Detection App, make sure you have the following installed:

Python
OpenCV (cv2)
pandas
You can install OpenCV and pandas using the following pip commands:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install pandas
Usage
Clone or download the Color Detection App repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/color-detection-app
Ensure that you have an image file (e.g., pic1.jpg) in the project directory that you want to analyze. You can replace this file with your own image.

Run the Color Detection App using Python:

bash
Copy code
python color_detection.py
This will open a window displaying the selected image.

Double-click on any area of the image to detect the dominant color in that region. The color name and RGB values will be displayed in a rectangle on the image.

Press the 'Esc' key to exit the application.

Customization
You can customize the behavior of the Color Detection App by modifying the script (color_detection.py). Some aspects you may want to customize include:

Image Path: Change the img_path variable to specify the path to your desired image.

Color Definitions: You can modify the colors.csv file to include your own color definitions. The CSV file should contain columns for color name, hex code, and RGB values.

Image Resize: You can change the dimensions to which the image is resized by modifying the cv2.resize function call.

Window Name: If you want to change the name of the window that displays the image, modify the argument in the cv2.namedWindow function.

Acknowledgments
This Color Detection App was created as a learning project and is based on the OpenCV and pandas libraries. It provides a simple example of how to perform color detection in images using Python.

Feel free to modify and enhance this app to suit your specific requirements or use it as a starting point for more advanced computer vision projects.

Note: Make sure to respect copyright and usage rights when using images for color detection.
